# Fundamental-CSS-comprehension-MDN

My version of MDN's Assessment: Fundamental-CSS-comprehension

The objective of this assingment is to "test comprehension of 
fundamental CSS theory, syntax and mechanics". The exercise
involes completing a design of a business card/gamer card/social
media profile.
